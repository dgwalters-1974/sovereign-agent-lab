# ── Task A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TASK_A_NOTES = """The agent chose the Albanach in its final output but
would have been better if there was some confirmation of this earlier in 
chain or reasoning - perhaps then using a venue specific cost per customer to 
calculate the overall cost. This would also only require 'generate_event_flyer'
to be called once for the chosen venue rather than twice as is currently
the case. Would be nice to know why it chose the Albanach too.""" # optional — anything unexpected

The agent handles this situation in the sense it provides a clear error message
and doesn't try to obfuscate the issue. What would 
be better is if it could recognise that the tool doesn't exist before it tries
to call it (hallucinating) and provide a more constructive error message
i.e. 'You need to call the manager in order to do this' etc.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
As we saw in the last exercise, LangGraph has a generic loop 'node' that can retain
agency over what the system does at each iteration. So it can call another tool or
decide to stop and return some output to the user. This means it's really flexible
however it can have the tendency to loop indefinitely or maybe hallucinate if left
unchecked. The Rasa CALM agent is more constrained and while it maybe sacrifices some
flexibility, its behaviour is more predictable, easier to understand and perhaps more
robust.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
Really not sure what you're looking for here (!) but I think I was most surprised
when the agent tried to call the 'get_last_train_time' tool which as far as I can
tell doesn't exist. What makes this even more surprising is that it effectively made
up a name for the tool it 'wanted' to call.
